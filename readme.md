# piNet - MQTT Sensor Command and Control EXPERIMENTS

## Purpose
This repository contains experimental code that connects various hardware sensors and actuators to a central broker using MQTT as the main transport.  

* This project serves as a base for continuing to learn more about Python and designing a bespoke solution for monitoring my property *

Data is collected using various microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi SBCs.  All Pi have a connection to an isolated LAN, the broker also has access to the internet and is capable of receiving AX25 Packets over a 1200 baud amateur radio data link.
